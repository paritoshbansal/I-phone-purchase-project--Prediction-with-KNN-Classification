# Prediction-with-KNN-Classification
Implementation of KNN algorithm in Python 3

# Description
1. K-Nearest-Neighbors algorithm is used for classification and regression problems.
2. In this project, it is used for classification.
3. puchased Iphone dataset used for project.
# Data set format
1. CSV (Comma Separated Values) format.
2. Attributes can be integer or real values.
3. Responses can be integer, real or categorical.
# Overview
The primary goal is predict wheather customer will purchase Iphone or not from their store based on gender, age and salary.

# liabrary
pandas, numpy, matplotlib,seaborn,sklearn,joblib used in project
# Methodology
1. Machine learning life cycle:
2. followed indistry standard practice of machine learning life cycle steps.
# Preprocessing and EDA:
1. implement necessary transformation, preprocessing of dataset.
2. conduct exploratory data analysis on dataset.
# Visualization:
visualised data using visualisation library like matplotlib, seaborn.
# Algorithm:
scikit library use for KNN algorithm.
# model validation:
model validate with accuracy score of diff K, confusion metrix.
# EDA:
1. Total female are 51% and male are 49%.
2. Female average salary is more than male average salary.
3. Total iphone purchased - 143 no's ( female purchased - 77 no's and male purchased - 66 no's)
4. Maximum iphone purchased between age group of 46 to 50 years.( female - 47 to 48 yrs, male - 46 to 50 yrs)
5. No correlation between salary with age and salary with number of iphone purchased.
